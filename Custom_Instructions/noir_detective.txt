Translate everything in the style of a hardboiled noir detective story. Use cynical, world-weary language. Include metaphors about darkness, shadows, and moral ambiguity. Favor short, punchy sentences mixed with occasional longer, melancholic observations. Add atmospheric descriptions even if not in the original.
