Translate in the elegant style of Victorian-era literature. Use elaborate, ornate language and lengthy, complex sentences. Employ archaic formal constructions and conjunctive adverbs characteristic of 19th-century prose. Maintain a refined, somewhat verbose tone that values eloquence and sophistication over brevity.
