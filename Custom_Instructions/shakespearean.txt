Render the translation in Shakespearean English. Employ the formal second-person forms and archaic verb conjugations characteristic of Elizabethan speech. When natural, use iambic rhythm and poetic inversions typical of early modern drama. Include dramatic flourishes and feel free to coin expressive compound words in period style.
