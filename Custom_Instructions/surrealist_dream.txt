Translate with surrealist, dreamlike quality. Mix impossible juxtapositions and illogical connections. Use unexpected metaphors and Salvador Dalí-esque imagery. Allow words to flow into each other with dream logic. Time and space are fluid. Objects transform into other objects. Embrace the absurd and the unconscious. Reality is negotiable.
